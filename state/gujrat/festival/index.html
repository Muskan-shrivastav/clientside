                            <p>Navaratri is an annual Hindu festival observed in the honour of the goddess Durga. It spans over nine nights (and ten days), first in the month of Chaitra (March/April of the Gregorian calendar), and again in the month of Sharada. It is observed for different reasons and celebrated differently in various parts of the Hindu Indian cultural sphere.

                                Theoretically, there are four seasonal Navaratri. However, in practice, it is the post-monsoon autumn festival called Sharada Navaratri. The festival is celebrated in the bright half of the Hindu calendar month Ashvin, which typically falls in the Gregorian months of September and October. </p>

                            <p>Uttarayan is a Hindu festival in celebration of the winter solstice and the transition to springtime, as well as the harvest.

                                The name Uttarayan often refers to the period between the winter solstice and the summer solstice, but sometimes the name is used to refer to a celebration lasting a few days.
                                
                                In some places, Uttarayan is celebrated with kite flying, and the name Uttarayan is sometimes used as the name of a kite festival, notably in the Indian state of Gujarat. Uttarayan is sometimes called Makar Sankranti. Similar festivals that take place at the same time are known as Pongal and Lohri, though these may be considered entirely separate observances (even though they also celebrate the harvest and the transition to springtime).</p>
