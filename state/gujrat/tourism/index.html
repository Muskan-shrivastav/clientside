                            <p>Nestled deep within the Sahyadri mountains in India, almost bordering the western Indian state of Maharashtra, is Gujarat’s only hill station – Saputara.

                                Home to a massive and beautiful lake, green rolling hills dotted by velvety meadows, and several monsoon-fed waterfalls, the hill station of Saputara makes for a pretty sight. Very often, you will be reminded of Switzerland’s charming villages with picturesque mountain peaks and glittery turquoise lakes.
                                
                                And then, you will be transferred back to an exotic rural microcosm in India bathed in the rich culture of native tribes, local food, and ethnic art. That is the magic of Saputara, the hidden gem of Gujarat which is also one of the prettiest hill stations that I have visited in India. </p>

                                One of the most attractive places in Diu is the Ghoghla beach. Located in the north of Diu town with not many people, it catches the attention of the tourists who prefer to stay aloof and not with the crowd. With standard restaurants around the place along with water sports, this beach stands complete. Lesser tourists are the reason for a much cleaner Ghoghla beach compared to the other beaches in the town.

                            <p> Indroda Dinosaur and Fossil Park is a precious treasure spread over an area of about 400 hectares on either bank of Sabarmati river in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat. Indroda Park is regarded as India's Jurrasic Park, it is run by the Gujarat Ecological Education and Research Foundation (GEER), and is one of the only two dinosaur museums in the country. The park consists of a zoo, massive skeletons of sea mammals like the blue whale, as well as a vast botanical garden, amphitheater, interpretation center, and camping facilities.

                            <p>Amazia refers to a condition where one or both of the mammary glands is absent (the nipple and areola remain present).[1] This may occur either congenitally or iatrogenically (typically the result of surgical removal and/or radiation therapy). Amazia can be treated with breast implants.

                                Amazia differs from amastia (the complete absence of breast tissue, nipple, and areola), although the two conditions are often (erroneously) thought to be identical. The terms "amazia" and "amastia" are thus often used interchangeably, even though the two conditions are medically different.
