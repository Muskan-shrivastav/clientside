                            <p>Chapati dough is made with whole white flour (finer), oil/ghee seasoned with salt by binding flour mostly with water. Chapatis are an everyday food, cooked on a griddle usually without an oil or ghee and often puffed up by cooking on open flame after taking it off the flame, some ghee is spread on the top. Thepla is often multigrain, usually made with whole wheat flour with the addition of chickpea and millet flour. When made for travel, the flour for theplas is bound into a stiff dough using milk instead of water, and with extra ghee/oil. This is done in order to increase their shelf life..

                            <p>This gluten-free flatbread made from bajra is a Kathiawadi legacy and is much loved. The thickly rolled rotlo is traditionally cooked over a cow-dung fire that imparts a smoky flavour. Now, they are cooked on a tava and then roasted on an open flame. Best enjoyed with ringan no olo (Gujarati baingan bharta) and garlic chutney.Once shaped, the dough is cooked on a tava griddle pan over high flames until it puffs up and brown spots develop on both sides. Rotla is usually served immediately because if it cools down it will become dry and hard. It's recommended to serve this flatbread with jaggery, ghee, and garlic chutney. </p>
