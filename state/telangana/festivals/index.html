                            <p>Bonalu is a traditional Hindu festival centered on the Goddess Mahakali from Telangana.[1] This festival is celebrated annually in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, as well as in other parts of the state.[2] It is celebrated in the month of Ashada Masam, which is around July and/or August. Special "poojas" (worship/ ceremonies) are performed for Yellamma (one of the many regional forms of Mahakali) on the first and last day of the festival.[3] The festival is also considered a thanksgiving to the Goddess for fulfillment of vows.[ </p>
